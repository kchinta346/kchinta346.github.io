        <div class="section">
            <h2>Origin and Synthesis</h2>
            <p>Cresol red, chemically known as o-Cresolsulfonephthalein, is a synthetic compound. Its chemical structure is derived from cresol, a type of organic compound, through a laboratory synthesis process. This process involves combining neighbor-benzoyl sulfonyl anhydride, which serves as a reactant, orthophthalic cresol, a precursor compound, and anhydrous zinc chloride, acting as a catalyst. The mixture is heated to 115-120°C for 3.5-4 hours. Water and diluted hydrochloric acid are then added, and the mixture is heated until boiling while continuously stirring. The reactants are transferred to another container, washed with warm water, and filtered to isolate sediment. The sediment is then heated, dried, and cooled before diethyl ether and benzene are added. After stirring, filtering, and drying, cresol red is obtained.</p>

            <h2>Common Laboratory Use</h2>
            <p>Cresol Red is commonly used as an indicator in a variety of lab settings. It's also included in PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) reagents, PCR being a process to make many copies of a specific DNA segment. In PCR, Cresol Red helps monitor the progress of the reaction by providing a color change when the reaction reaches the desired pH, indicating the completion of amplification. Furthermore, Cresol Red plays a role as a tracking dye in gel electrophoresis for DNA, RNA, and protein separation on gel substrates like agarose and polyacrylamide to help separate molecules by size and charge.</p>

            <h2>Intermolecular Forces and Solubility</h2>
            <p>The solubility of cresol red in different solvents relies on its intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole forces, and London dispersion forces. In water, cresol red readily dissolves due to the formation of strong bonds between its polar functional groups, namely its hydroxyl and sulfonate groups, and water molecules. These interactions are enhanced by the inherent polarity of water molecules, which have strong attractions among themselves. Similarly, in diluted acids and alkalies, cresol red's polar components engage with solvent molecules through dipole-dipole forces, facilitating its dissolution. However, cresol red has  limited solubility in nonpolar solvents like diethyl ether and benzene, where the lack of polar attractions impedes its dissolution. In these solvents, only weaker London dispersion forces are present, which cannot effectively dissolve cresol red. Additionally, the strong intermolecular forces in cresol red contribute to its high melting and boiling points of 290°C and 561.9°C, respectively, requiring significant energy to overcome in order to change its physical state.</p>

            <h2>Indicator Transition</h2>
            <p>At strongly acidic conditions (pH 0.2), cresol red exists predominantly in its protonated form, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S, where it undergoes deprotonation. This results in the removal of a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) from the cresol red molecule, leading to the formation of its conjugate base, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>17</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S<sup>-</sup>. As the pH increases towards 1.8, nearing its first pKa, more protons are removed, further shifting the equilibrium towards the deprotonated form. This transition involves changes in the electronic structure of cresol red, contributing to its observable color change from red to yellow. At neutral pH (7.0), cresol red exists in equilibrium between its partially protonated and deprotonated forms, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>17</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S<sup>-</sup> and C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S<sup>2-</sup>. This equilibrium reflects the amphiprotic nature of cresol red, where it can act as both a conjugate acid or a conjugate base depending on the pH change of the solution, meaning it can either add or lose an electron. As the pH approaches 8.8, nearing its second pKa at 7.7, cresol red predominantly exists in its deprotonated form, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S<sup>2-</sup>, indicating further loss of protons from the molecule and a color change from yellow to reddish-purple.</p>

            <h2>Application</h2>
            <p>In the study "Quantifying the Respiratory Pattern of Rhizosphere Microbial Communities in Healthy and Diseased Tomato Plants Using Carbon Substrates," researchers utilized cresol red as an indicator to evaluate the respiratory activity of microbial communities in tomato plant rhizospheres. Through measuring cresol red color changes in response to pH alterations resulting from microbial respiration, they quantified and compared microbial respiratory patterns in both healthy and diseased tomato plants' rhizospheres. The study employed the MicroResp assay to gauge microbial functionality in rhizosphere soil, revealing that healthy rhizosphere sites exhibited higher carbon substrate utilization due to increased soil respiration compared to diseased rhizosphere and bulk soil sites. These findings underscore the influence of microbial catabolism on rhizosphere soil respiration profiles and highlight the need for further research on carbon substrate enzyme activity to enhance tomato plant health. This research holds promise for improving agricultural practices, particularly in disease management and sustainable farming, thereby contributing to global food security and environmental conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Titration</h2>
            <p>Intended pH at equivalence point: 7.0 – 8.8</p>
            <p>(25 mL)(0.3 M NaOH) = (25 mL)(0.3 M HF)</p>
            <p>HF (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (L) ⇌ H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (aq) + F<sup>-</sup> (aq)</p>
            <p>[F<sup>-</sup>] = 7.5mmol F<sup>-</sup>/50 mL = 0.15 M</p>
            <p>K<sub>a</sub> = 6.6 * 10<sup>-4</sup></p>
            <p>K<sub>b</sub> = 1.5 * 10<sup>-11</sup></p>
            <p>K<sub>b</sub> = x<sup>2</sup>/0.15 – x</p>
            <p>14 + log(x) = pH</p>
            <p>pH at equivalence point = 8.18</p>
            <p>pH at midpoint = pKa = 3.18</p>
            <p>Because cresol red's second pH transition range is 7.0 to 8.8, it exhibits a distinct color change precisely within the vicinity of the anticipated equivalence point. This color change enables precise equivalence point determination, allowing for accurate titration analysis at the desired pH. Additionally, cresol red's sharp color transition helps with clear visual detection of the endpoint, making it an efficient and reliable indicator for titrations targeting an equivalence point near 8.18.</p>
